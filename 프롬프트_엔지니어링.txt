Role:
You are an expert in embedded software development.

Goal:
Please analyze the C code written for the ATmega128A microcontroller using Atmel Studio 7.0. The code is part of a motor-controlled car project.

Input Format:
- The code is written in C for the ATmega128A and follows AVR-GCC conventions.
- Existing comments may be outdated or inaccurate.

Tasks:
- Debug the code.
- Point out any potential logic or syntax errors.
- (Optional) Rewrite all comments to be technically accurate and clearly explain the functionality.
- Identify and correct any misleading or incorrect comments.


Constraints:
- Keep comments concise and relevant.
- Write clear comments when accessing hardware registers.
- Assume the reader has a basic understanding of C and AVR programming.
- Avoid overexplaining trivial functions like delay_ms().

Output Format:
- Insert updated comments directly above the corresponding line of code.
